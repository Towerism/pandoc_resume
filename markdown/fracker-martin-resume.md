Technical Experience
--------------------

Arch Linux
:   In the 4+ years of maintaining multiple arch linux systems, used them
    for both university studies as well as work. Originally having started with
    Ubuntu, switched to Arch Linux not only for the extra challenge, but also
    to gain a deeper understanding of the GNU/Linux ecosystem of software in general.

Open Source
:   Started several small hobby projects to practice and learn new programming
    languages and frameworks (C++, Rust, Ruby, go, .Net, Angular, Vue.js, various
    node.js frameworks, etc).  Additionally contributed to existing projects
    through submitting and participating in github issues as well as through code
    contributions. Between professional engagements and open source, achieved 3
    years experience in .NET and 1 year in Angular.

Consulting
:   Demonstrated strong communication skills through frequent interactions with
    clients. Worked on various web based systems including a job candidate tracking
    system for internal use, a loan origination and analysis system for agribusiness,
    a well execution planning system for the oil and gas industry, and a social media
    platform for medium-to-large companies.
