Technical Experience

Arch Linux
:   In the 4+ years of maintaining multiple arch linux systems, used them
    for both university studies as well as work. Originally having started with

    to gain a deeper understanding of the GNU/Linux ecosystem of software in general.

Open Source
:   Started several small hobby projects to practice and learn new programming languages and
    frameworks (C++, Rust, Ruby, Go, various node.js frameworks, etc). Additionally
    contributed to existing projects through submitting and participating in github issues
    as well as through code contributions.

Consulting
:   Demonstrated strong communication skills through frequent interactions with
    clients. Worked on various web based systems including a job candidate tracking
    system for internal use, a loan origination and analysis system for agribusiness,
    a well execution planning system for the oil and gas industry, and a social media
    platform for medium-to-large companies.
